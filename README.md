# Store A Project

Store A is Angular application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process with stripe api.

## Project description

### Features

- **Products list page**, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
- **Product details page**, which displays more information about any particular product
- **My cart**, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
- **Check-out**, using stripe
- **Order confirmation page**, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process

### Backend API

For the backend API, you should see the [Store-Backend-Project](https://github.com/hykim-soulis/Store-Backend-Project) and run the project in local port 8000.
